I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Twente in the Mathematics of Imaging & AI group (MIA) and in the [MAGNUS group](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/sacs/).

My research is supported by

* <b> NWO VIDI grant (2025– ) </b>: "SPARGO: Exploring and Exploiting the Geometric Landscape of Infinite-Dimensional Sparse Optimization"
* <b> NWO M1 Open Competition grant (2024- ) </b>: "Curve Ensemble Gradient Descent for Dynamic Problems"

<b> News: </b>
* Dec 2025: Our paper ["Nonlocal perimeters and variations: Extremality and decomposability for finite and infinite horizons"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.05149) has been accepted for publication in Calculus of Variations and Partial Differential Equations
* Nov 2025: <b>I have been awarded a Vidi grant from the NWO (Dutch Research Council). [link](https://www.utwente.nl/en/news/2025/10/645168/six-vidi-grants-for-ut-researchers) </b>
* Oct 2025: I gave an online talk at "Math Machine Learning seminar MPI MIS + UCLA" titled: "Exact sparse reconstruction and stability for infinite wide shallow neural networks"
    
<b> Upcoming events: </b>
* Nov 2025-Jan 2026: I will be a guest in Prof. Gabriele Steidl group at TU Berlin. Reach out if you want to discuss research! 
* Feb 2026: I will give a talk in the "Workshop on Gradient Structures" at University of Augsburg
* Mar 2026: I will give a talk at GAMM 2026 in Stuttgart
* Apr 2026: I will give a talk at NMC 2026
