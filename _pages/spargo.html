<b> Summary. </b> 

<em> It is becoming clear that our society is overwhelmed by a growing flood of information, much of which is either redundant or unreliable. 
Even in our daily lives, we constantly face the challenge of filtering content from a variety of media. One way to tackle this challenge is through 
compression methods, which are already widely applied to finite-dimensional data. However, when it comes to infinite-dimensional structures which are 
often used to describe modern data, such methods remain unexplored. SPARGO aims to bridge this gap by developing a new framework for 
infinite-dimensional compression </em>
