It is becoming clear that our society is overwhelmed by a growing flood of information, much of which is either redundant or unreliable. 
Even in our daily lives, we constantly face the challenge of filtering content from a variety of media. One way to tackle this challenge is through 
compression methods, which are already widely applied to finite-dimensional data. However, when it comes to infinite-dimensional structures which are 
often used to describe modern data, such methods remain unexplored. 
<br>
<b> SPARGO aims to bridge this gap by developing a new framework for infinite-dimensional compression </b>

<b> SPARGO aims to achieve the following objectives: </b> 


<ul>
  <li> <b> <p style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Sparse stability in infinite dimension.</p></b>Is infinite-dimensional <b> sparsity preserved under perturbations </b> of the optimization problem?  <b> SPARGO  </b> addresses this
question by investigating how the ability to solve an optimization problem using only few building blocks is stable
with respect to various types of perturbations.  </li>
  <li> <b> <p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;"> Analysis of Atomic Gradient Descents approaches. </p> </b> How can we use the sparse structure of infinite-dimensional optimization problems to  <b> design algorithms</b>? The
characterization of the sparse building blocks of a given optimization problem is instrumental to design algorithms
that use such structure in the iterate.  <b> SPARGO  </b> introduces a new class of infinite-dimensional sparse optimization algorithms
named  <b> Atomic Gradient Descent methods  </b> that is built on such principle. </li>
</ul>

The development of compression and sparse methods in infinite dimension has been limited by the lack of a suitable general  <b> notion of sparsity  </b> that would provide information
on how we should <b> optimally represents infinite-dimensional data </b>. It has been generally accepted that compressing
means optimally representing data using a collection of <b> few simple building blocks </b>. However, no general recipe has been given to understand the reason why certain building blocks should be used instead of
others. <b> SPARGO advocates that the sparsity features of a given infinite-dimensional model are determined by its geometric properties </b>. It thus aims to characterize building blocks and provide sparse representations by
studying the geometric structure of an optimization problems. Such sparse, or compressed, representations will be then instrumental to provide  <b> reconstruction guarantees </b> as well as to <b> design compression algorithms </b> that take advantage optimal sparse representations
